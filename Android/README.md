## This folder contains problem set in Android Tract
Below I will mention some notable challenges I encounter when solving the problems

1. **Pokedex**
  * This is kinda the legit first time I am exposed to android workspace ( I have only created a number guessing game previously
    ) To be honest, I felt like giving up right here at Pokedex because I don't really get all the adapter viewHolder xml intent 
    stuff (I am still not very familiar with it) at first in the first video especially and also in the second video. 
    So I went to some Udemy and Youtube tutorials before proceeding.
  * After some sufficient understandings, things getting clearer and I am able to work it out. I have described my understandings
    to the codes in my code, feel free to check. Overall I am still confused on how API query works. This is because I had to 
    nest the second query in the first in one of the function to call for the description of the pokemon, I will research more 
    about this in future.
    
2. **Fiftygram**
  * Suddenly everything becomes easier here. Just need to learn how to open gallery, save and run some functons to modify bitmaps.
  * I feel like this is more suitable as first task rather than pokedex....
  
3. **Notes**
  * This is using back the same recyclerview again, however this time I am more familiar with it so not much of a problem with it.
  * The main difficulty for me is to understand how the Room module works and how NotesDatabase.java is functioning. I am going to
    study more about it later. Other than the importing sql part, the rest are easier as well. SQL commands was taught in lecture 7
    and the others are just implementing it.
  * Finally, I implemented the swipe to delete function after finding a tutorial online on how it works, but I described it in my
    codes as well.
    
This whole Android Studio is a brand new experience for me, the beginning of it especially was really hard. After this, I plan
  to make a new Pokedex using grid view and recycler view and combining some features from Notes and Fiftygram. Hopefully it'll 
  turn out nice.
