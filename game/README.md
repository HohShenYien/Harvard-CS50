 ## This folder contains problem set in Game track
Below I will mention some notable challenges I encounter when solving the problems

1. **pong**
  * Prior to this, I've created several rpg-like games using pygame. So overall it feels like going over same type of
    programming except in another language which is lua. Comparing this track to Android track, I feel like game track is much
    easier, another reason being my experience on OOP concept already. So creating classes and functions aren't confusing to me.
  * Only 1 main problem was loading the class.lua file. I had a problem earlier when creating Paddle.lua class and got
    an exception of which Class variable is a boolean? So can't access it. I solved it by replacing the version of class.lua
    file downloaded from github with the one provided by CS50, problem solves.
  * Other than those, pong is quite fun to write, the whole lua language felt like cleaner and simpler than using pygame, but 
    with some experience, I believe recreating this pong game in either pygame or love2d is quite simple.
  * PS: I plan to upgrade some features in this game as well in these few days, maybe after making the upgraded version of pokedex
    or maybe after finishing the web track.
