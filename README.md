# Harvard CS50
This is my project on completing Harvard CS50 course.

## The Process

* I have started the course on 11/4/2020 due to coronavirus outbreak while preparing for my coming degree in computer science.
* All my previous knowledge in computer science isn't really organised or formal, so I used this time to complete my knowledge.
* Prior to this, I've leant Python around June 2019 and tried some problems on Leetcode. So the earlier problems did not post too     
  much challenge for me. 
* I find the lectures are really interesting and the lecturer was really energetic which is what I like most in the course.
  Besides, some of the problems were rather challenging as well .
* The date of completion is the same as the date I posted them here.
* There is a big gap between pset 3 and pset 4 due to my A2 examination in May, resumed after finishing the exam.
  
* This is my final projectPomodoro Focus](https://github.com/HohShenYien/Pomodoro_Focus)

  P.S I didn't know much about github before my pset2, so some of the earlier projects were uploaded around that day.
