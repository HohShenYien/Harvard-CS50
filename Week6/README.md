 ## This folder contains problem set 6
Below I will mention some notable challenges I encounter when solving the problems

PS: Due to my prior experience in Python, most of the problems in pset6 aren't really hard
    especially when the problems have been done before in C. Most of it I used the same concept
    , just translating the code into Python, not really too difficult for me.
    
**dna.py**
* I think this is the hardest problem, rather obviously. I see that I can either use regex to find the match, or
  simply search the substrings one by one as what Brian mentioned in the walkthrough. I've used regex for this purpose.
* Then, compare the match sequence with the person is also very simple as I used dictionary, so overall only the regex
  syntax is more of the challenging part in this problem.
