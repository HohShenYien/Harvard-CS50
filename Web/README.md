 ## This folder contains problem set in Web track
Below I will mention some notable challenges I encounter when solving the problems

1. **homepage**
  * Unlike game and android track, this track gives a lot of freedom, especially on this problem.
  * Hence, I made some simple pages which use bootstrap and some javascript, still not very used to front-end stuff, but I think learning android xml
    is a good help for understanding HTML and CSS better
  * Here's the link to my homepage: https://hohshenyien.github.io/Harvard-CS50/Web/homepage/index.html

2. **finance**
  * Another interesting project, though quite a lot of the codes were implemented already by CS50, it still gives a lot of
    freedom for us to implement the codes.
  * Uses Flask from Python, which luckily I am familiar with Python, so this problem wasn't too difficult, but it takes quite a lot of time
    to implement the features. Out of all additional features, I picked the easier add credit function since I didn't plan to delve further
    on this topic.
