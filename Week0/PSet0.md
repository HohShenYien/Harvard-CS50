## This folder contains problem set 1

* This week's problem was just to make a simple game on [scratch](https://scratch.mit.edu/).

* This website is really user-friendly and I've replicated a simple chrome's dinosaur game on it. It can be further improved, 
  but I think it is sufficient for problem set 1.

* Here's the link to my game [Modified_Dinosaur_Game](https://scratch.mit.edu/projects/384541106/)
