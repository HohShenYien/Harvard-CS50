# Harvard CS50
This is my project on completing Harvard CS50 course.

## The Process

* I have started the course on 11/4/2020 due to coronavirus outbreak while preparing for my coming degree in computer science.
* Prior to this, I've leant Python around June 2019 and tried some problems on Leetcode. So the earlier problems did not post too much 
  challenge for me. 
* I find the lectures are really interesting and the lecturer was really energetic which is what I like most in the course. Besides, 
  some of the problems were rather challenging as well .
