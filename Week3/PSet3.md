## This folder contains problem set 3
Below I will mention some notable challenges I encounter when solving the problems

1. **plurality.c**
  * This is a rather easy problem, which I believe can be further optimised using hashmap.
    However,since it wasn't taught and I do not know the syntax in c, I will use the linear
    search method to obtain the candidate's name.
  * The outline of the code is given by CS50 team.
