## This folder contains problem set 1
Below I will mention some notable challenges I encounter when solving the problems

1. **credit.c**
  * This was a rather challenging problem, especially on dealing with integers at different digit.
  * Luckily, similar problems I have seen in leetcode. This means continuously dividing by 10, and take the remainder to get each number.
  * I have done the same in obtaining length of numbers.
  
Frankly speaking, with some prior experience in coding, the other problems aren't too difficult for me
