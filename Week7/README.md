 ## This folder contains problem set 6
Below I will mention some notable challenges I encounter when solving the problems

1. **movies**
  * SQL is really something very new to me, I have no prior experience on this. Luckily, the syntax for SQL seems to
    be quite simple compare to a programming language, plus it's mainly English-like structure so it's quite fine. Some 
    special syntax to take into account was SELECT DISTINCT in one of the problems and another was the way everything 
    is nested together. Overall the problems are quite okay if the instructions are read carefully.
    
2. **houses**
  * Using python to execute sql was quite interesting. I used the standard sqlite3 library instead of cs50's SQL function.
    Besides, the problems aren't too difficult either, just pay attention to the middle name part.
