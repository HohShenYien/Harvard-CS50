Below I will mention some notable challenges I encounter when solving the problems

1. **speller_dictionary.c**
   * This is nowhere near easy. More things to be taken care. Most of it can be solved eventually with some 
     efforts and I searched for wikipedia for the hashing function I used. The sole problem I faced was
     that I accidentally freed tmp pointer in the load function, more details in the file. My code took too long
     to pass for the challenge, I guess 2999 buckets is too less for it, nevertheless, I've had enough of this code
     today.
